<h2>High School #2</h2>

<p2>Posted on December 14, 2022 23:38 PM</p2>

<p>I just had a huge argument with my friend this morning.
</p>    
<p>We have talked a lot about the theory of evolution. and then my friend believes that the Komodo actually comes from the evolution of the dinosaurs. but I don't agree with that.</p>
<p>and then I was just walking up to the stairs and I met my former biology teacher. So he asking me
</p>
<p>"What were you guys talking about?"</p>
<p>"Evolution Theory, my friend just said that the Komodo comes from the evolution of the dinosaurs"</p>
<p>"No, no. But the shape is similar. But the Komodo is not from the evolution of dinosaurs"</p>

<h2>Bocchi The Rock! #3</h2>

<p2>Posted on December 04, 2022 15:35 PM</p2>

<p>I honestly think episode 8 is a good episode, idk but the anime isn't finished yet. But in that episode there was something that made me sad Nijika Ichiji. She confesses to Hitori that she is not really good at drumming. 
    And plus, It's about Hitori, She is thinking about how cruel life would be in the 
    future if She didn't have the good skills to get a job and survive in the World of Capitalism. </p>
    <p>Yes, You know unfortunately it really applies to me right now.</p>

   <h2>Reimu Hakurei (博麗　霊夢 Hakurei Reimu)</h2>
    <p>Reimu Hakurei (博麗　霊夢 Hakurei Reimu) is the main protagonist of the Touhou Project series along with the deuteragonist, 
    <br>Marisa Kirisame. As the shrine maiden of the Hakurei Shrine, she manages the Hakurei Border of Gensokyo and exterminates troublesome youkai.
    <br>
    <br>Reimu Hakurei (博麗　霊夢 Hakurei Reimu) is the Main Character of the Touhou Project series, having appeared in all of 
    <br> the main games and in almost every game in the series. As the sole maiden of the Hakurei Shrine, she is commonly 
    <br>called upon (or calls it upon herself) to investigate strange occurrences throughout Gensokyo.
<br>
        <br>In earlier games, Reimu's spiritual abilities were highly limited. (In Highly Responsive to Prayers, she 
        <br>was unable to directly harm enemies at all.) As time passed, however, she developed her abilities, becoming 
        <br>able to manipulate the Hakurei Yin-Yang Orb, special amulets, and her own spiritual power to fight more effectively. 
        <br>Sometime between Mystic Square and Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, she realized the ability to fly under her own 
        <br>jurisdiction. (Before then, she relied on Genjii, her turtle familiar, to fly.)
<br>        
        <br>Reimu is commonly described as easygoing, curious, dutiful, and optimistic — sometimes overly so. 
        <br>Her personality seems sympathetic toward many individuals; there are few characters who remain her 
        <br>rivals past the first encounter. Her shrine has become a moderately popular locale for some of 
        <br>Gensokyo's residents.</p>
